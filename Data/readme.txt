Victoria mangrove pixels.tif is a 2017 Victorian mangrove map created by using XGBoost. 

I've used the extent: extent(c(329000, 375000, -4250000, -4215000)) as my sample window for now. 
The minimum AOO ('correct answer') I got us 2, though 4 seems to be the median. Any method that 
gets us to 2 quickest should be our target!
